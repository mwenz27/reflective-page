# Reflection Log

This is a simple web application that allows users to keep a reflective log. It includes the following features:
- A form for users to input information about their day, including what they did, what didn't go well, and what could have gone better.
- A date-time picker for users to select the date and time of the reflection.
- A button to set the date-time to the current date and time.
- A submit button to display the input values in the page.
- A copy to clipboard button to copy the displayed input values.

The application uses Bootstrap 4 for styling, and the clipboard.js library for the copy to clipboard feature.

## How to use
1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Fill in the form with information about your day.
3. Select the date and time of the reflection, or use the "Set Date-Time Now" button to set it to the current date and time.
4. Click the "Submit" button to display the input values in the page.
5. Click the "Copy" button to copy the displayed input values to the clipboard.

The application includes two additional pages, a "Reflections" page and a "Questions" page, which is accessible via the navigation buttons on the top of the page.
